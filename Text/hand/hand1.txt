Good morning. Are you the new transfer student?
Nice to meet you.
I'm Hand.
I'm a professional Rock Paper Scissors player.
{I challenge you!|I prefer basketball.|That's boring.}
<A>
I'd be happy to try.
I just don't think you'd stand a chance.
You don't even have hands.
<B>
...
I thought about basketball, but...
I just don't have time for it.
I need to train for Rock Paper Scissors.
<C>
It's fine once you get used to it.
I'm quite popular among fans, so there's always people cheering for me.
