Oh, hi Blonger.
I'm exhausted right now.
Training has been so tough...
My big match is soon.
Do you wanna have a training match with me?
{Rock.|Paper.|Scissors.}
<A>
Looks like I win.
<B>
Beat you.
<C>
You lose.
<END>
Looks like I'm ready, then.
Haaaahh....
I wish I was doing something else...
Like basketball...
{Why do you play Rock Paper Scissors?|You should quit.|Basketball sucks.}
<A>
I have to...
I'm so good, it'd be a waste not to.
Everyone says so...
<B>
I can't.
It's all I've ever known.
I wouldn't know what else to do.
<C>
No!
Basketball is amazing!
It's so interesting.
Much better than Rock Paper Scissors...
<END>
I don't know what to do...
I guess I'l just keep training then.
I hope you'll come watch my match, Blonger.
See you there.
