Oh, it's you.
What do you want?
An autograph?
I'm sure you heard about the qualifiers.
I won so hard I'm a world champion now.
I don't have time for you.
Make it quick.
{Can I have an autograph?|Wanna hang out?|Let's play Rock Paper Scissors.}
<A>
I guess I can give you one in my infinite graciousness.
And as thanks for being a stepstone to get me out of Rock Paper Scissors.
My autograph is worth a lot of money, so be thankful.
I'm not sure you even deserve this.
<B>
No.
Stop wasting my time.
I should be playing basketball.
<C>
GUARDS!!
Take this fool away!
They mentioned that sport!
When I become president due to my basketball skills, I will outlaw that stupid sport.
<END>
You really love wasting my time, huh?
Go away, now.
I hope I never see you again.
