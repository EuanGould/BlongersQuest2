Blonger?
What are you doing here?
Are you my opponent?
I didn't realize you also played competitive Rock Paper Scissors.
The basketball qualifiers are starting in a moment.
[handunhappy]
I won't even be able to watch them.
I have to play this stupid match...
[handneutral]
Unless...
...
Our matching is starting, Blonger.
Let's go.
{Rock.|Paper.|Scissors.}
<A>
[handscissors]
Hehehe.
I LOST!
<B>
[handrock]
Hah!
My first loss!
<C>
[handpaper]
...
You win.
<END>
[handhappyvery]
NOT SO GOOD AT ROCK PAPER SCISSORS NOW, AM I?
I'M OFF TO THE BASKETBALL QUALIFIERS!
I will make it through and be the best basketball champion the world has ever seen.
{Did you throw the match?|Ball hard, my friend.|You shouldn't abandon your talent.}
<A>
[handangry]
Are you implying I would do something so dishonest??
My loss was completely fair.
I was outplayed.
[handneutral]
Totally.
<B>
I will be balling.
No one will ever ball like me again.
<C>
[handangry]
WHAT TALENT??
I LOST!!
[handneutral]
Without talent, I can only follow my passion.
[handhappy]
Basketball.
<END>
[handneutral]
I must leave now.
Basketball waits for no one.
