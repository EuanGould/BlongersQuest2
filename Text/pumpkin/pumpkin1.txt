Yo!
I've never seen anyone like you around before!
[pumpkinhappy]
Including you!
[pumpkinneutral]
Wait!
[pumpkinhappy]
Are you here to join the team!?
{Yes!|No.|What team?}
<A>
[pumpkinhappy]
WOW!!
THAT'S SO-
[pumpkinstill]
Augh. Sorry... Ahem...
[pumpkinhappy]
THAT'S SO COOL!
You're pretty short too! It's cool that you're not letting that get you down!
[pumpkinneutral]
Though I gotta warn you, we're a pretty good team already so you better be made of stern stuff if you want to join.
[pumpkinhappy]
We might even make the Biglittle Monster League this year!
<B>
[pumpkinunhappy]
Oh... But...
Aw man...
[pumpkinshrinkingunhappy]
You're so tall as well... I think you'd be really good at it...
And we're trying to make the Biglittle Monster League this year...
[pumpkinveryshrinkingunhappy]
You could've really helped...
<C>
[pumpkinhappy]
Our basketball team obviously! The Handheld Turrets!
We're gunning for the Biglittle Monster League this year and I think we have a good shot!
And I love all things basketball! I love the ball, the baskets...
[pumpkinslowerhappy]
The way the ball gets bounced around...
[pumpkinstillhappy]
And thrown around between the players...
[pumpkinunhappy]
And the way it gets dunked into the net...
<END>
[pumpkinneutral]
Wait! You're that new exchange student we were told about!
[pumpkinhappy]
It's so great to meet you!
[pumpkinunhappy]
All the other exchange students keep getting vapourised by the Incomprehensible Orb Being
[pumpkinshrinkingunhappy]
They kept killing them before I even got to say hi...
[pumpkinhappy]
So HI!!!
[pumpkinneutral]
You should avoid dying!!
