Hey Blonger!
Didn't you hear? Yeah we lost.

Really got our butts handed to us my the Sinfulcinatti Sawed Offs.

And honestly my heart wasn't really in it. So the Handheld Turrets are out of the league for now.

It's ok, I was never that into actually playing basketball.

But I still made the league!!!

It's a funny story really.

[pumpkinfasthappy]
I WAS THE BALL!!!!!!!
[pumpkinblush]
And even better, I'm gonna be in the Biglittle League after all!
[pumpkinhappy]
As the ball!

Thank you Blonger...
