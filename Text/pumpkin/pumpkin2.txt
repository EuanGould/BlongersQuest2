Hi again!
How are you doing? 
Anyone picking on you?
[pumpkinangry]
If someone were... Oh I'd give them the what for... A piece of my mind...
[pumpkinneutral]
It's probably hard to imagine but I was picked on once...
{Really?|But you're so tough, how?|That makes sense.}
<A>
[pumpkinneutral]
Yeah! If you can believe it.
<B>
[pumpkinblush]
Oh well um...
[pumpkinhappy]
Even tough guys have problems if you can believe it.
<C>
[pumpkinangry]
What's that supposed to mean!?
[pumpkinunhappy]
Do you really mean that?
<END>
[pumpkinunhappy]
Always calling me names and...
[pumpkinblush]
Throwing me around and stuff...
[pumpkinhappy]
Like a ball...
[pumpkinneutral]
That part wasn't so bad...
[pumpkinstill]
...
[pumpkinunhappy]
So real jerks.
{Do you like being a basketball?|Sounds rough.|Thrown around?}
<A>
[pumpkinangry]
NO!!
[pumpkinblush]
...
[pumpkinangry]
NO!!
[pumpkinunhappy]
... That would be weird.
[pumpkinshrinkingunhappy]
... People would think I'm weird.
[pumpkinveryshrinkingunhappy]
Please don't think I'm weird.
I don't like being a ball...
I don't...
[pumpkinneutral]
because that would be weird.
[pumpkinhappy]
And anyway, the Incomprehensible Orb Being vaporised them so they're not around anymore.
<B>
[pumpkinneutral]
It wasn't too awful.
[pumpkinblush]
Sometimes they'd pass me around and toss me into round containers.
[pumpkinunhappy]
Occasionally the toilet...
[pumpkinshrinkingunhappy]
and one time a woodchipper...
[pumpkinhappy]
But usually just like a bucket or basket or something.
[pumpkinblush]
And I guess I didn't mind that all too much.
[backgroundcorridor]
[pumpkinhappy]
And anyway, the Incomprehensible Orb Being vaporised them so they're not around anymore.
<C>
[pumpkinhappy]
Yeah!
[pumpkinneutral]
I mean yeah, always passing me back and forth between them.
And sometimes into containers.
[pumpkinblush]
...
[pumpkinneutral]
One time they tried to throw me into a woodchipper though and was rude.
[pumpkinhappy]
They didn't even get expelled for that, turns out they were doing Chaos Powder in the bathrooms.
Then the Incomprehensible Orb Being vaporised them so they're not around anymore.
<END>
[pumpkinunhappy]
Maybe I'm oversharing a bit...
...
[pumpkinhappy]
OH YEAH!! GUESS WHAT!!
[pumpkinneutral]
The qualifier for the Biglittle Monster League is tomorrow, and the tickets are free!
[pumpkinunhappy]
Mainly because no one really cares until you're in the league but...
[pumpkinhappy]
If you wanna come along it'll be pretty easy to get a seat!!
End of program
