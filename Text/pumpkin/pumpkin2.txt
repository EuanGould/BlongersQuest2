Hi again!
How are you doing? 
Anyone picking on you?
[pumpkinangry]
If someone were... Oh I'd give them the what for... A piece of my mind...
[pumpkinneutral]
It's probably hard to imagine but I was picked on once...
{Really?|But you're so tough, how?|That makes sense.}
<A>
[pumpkinneutral]
Yeah! If you can believe it.
<B>
[pumpkinblush]
Oh well um...
[pumpkinhappy]
Even tough guys have problems if you can believe it.
<C>
[pumpkinangry]
What's that supposed to mean!?
[pumpkinunhappy]
Do you really mean that?
<END>
[pumpkinunhappy]
Always calling me names and...
[pumpkinunhappy]
...
[pumpkinblush]
Throwing me around and stuff...
[pumpkinstillhappy]
Like a ball...
[pumpkinneutral]
That part wasn't so bad...
[pumpkinstillneutral]
...
[pumpkinneutral]
So real jerks.
