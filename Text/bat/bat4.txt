Hi, Blonger!
I quit the basketball team!
Finally no more daily practice.
I have more time to spend with my toasters now.
Thank you so much for you help!
{You should go back to basketball.|We should go toaster shopping together.|You look like a nerd.}
<A>
NEVER!!!!
I LOVE TOASTERS!!!!!!
BASKETBALL SUCKS!!!!!!
<B>
YEESSSS!!
PLEASE!
I'm sure you have great taste.
We could have such a wonderful time together!
<C>
Yayyyy!
Thank you!
I will never be a cool guy again.
I will be the nerdiest nerd to ever collect toasters.
<END>
I feel like nothing I do will truly show my gratitude.
I know!
I will gift you my prized possession...
My favourite toaster.
I will miss it, but for you, it's worth it.
