I'm kinda a big deal around here.
The very best there is at basketball.
No one is better than me.
At anything.
But especially basketball.
Have you played before?

Real funny.
Everyone knows basketball.
It's the coolest thing there is.
And I'm the coolest for being so darn good at it.

Anyways.
You shouldn't tryout basketball.
It's not worth it.
You'd be overshadowed.
By me.
God, I'm so cool.
