How...
We lost...
B-but-
Aren't I the best?
I need to be cool...
How can I be cool without basketball...
What do I do?
*cries*
{You're always cool.|You were never cool.|Keep playing basketball.}
<A>
I-I am?
Me?
I don't have to play basketball?
<B>
H-Huh?
But I played basketball...
What else is there...
I can't do anything else...
<C>
There's no point...
I already tried...
What can I even do?
<END>
I... think I understand...
[batsunglassesfall]
I don't need to be cool.
I should just be myself.

I WILL PURSUE MY TRUE HOBBY!
I WILL LIVE MY LIFE TO ITS FULLEST!
FAREWELL MY GOOD FRIEND!
COOL BAT IS NO MORE!
