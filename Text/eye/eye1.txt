Oh hey! You're that new exchange student right?
[eyeunhappy]
I'm uh... Oh I guess you didn't ask, sorry...
[eyeunhappyextreme]
I mean um I'm... Eyeball...
{That's a nice name!|That tracks.|Ooh! What does is it mean?}
<A>
[eyeblush]
Oh you think so?
[eyeunhappy]
I dunno... I find it kinda... Reductive.
[eyeneutral]
I've been thinking about getting it changed soon.
<B>
[eyeunhappy]
Really? You think so? Aww man.
[eyeneutral]
I mean I know I'm an eye and all but it's just...
So... like aggressive almost... not quite...
[eyeunhappy]
I don't know how to describe it exactly.
But I suppose it's just too...
[eyeblush]
Masculine. For my tastes.
<C>
[eyeblush]

[eyeneutral]
Um uh it's like the bit of your head that lets you see.

[eyeunhappy]
I mean I like that it physically describes me in such a clever and creative way but...

[eyehappy]
Anyway!
I'm part of the basketball team here and we'll be practicing pretty soon.
[eyeunhappy]
It's the... Boys team here...
[eyeneutral]
And we're almost good enough to make the Biglittle Monster League this year!
[eyehappy]
I'd love to ball with some of the monsters in those teams!
I hear that some of the monsters are so good they're even made of basketballs!
[eyeblush]
So I'll uh... See you around...
