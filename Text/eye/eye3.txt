Oh hey Blonger!
[eyeneutral]
I have some uhh...
[eyeblush]
Big news...
I finally... Um...
[eyehappyextreme]
I changed my name!
[eyeunhappy]
At least in a personal capacity.
[eyehappy]
So henceforth I am...
[eyeblush]
Eye.
[eyehappy]
And I've decided that I'm going to live the rest of my life as a girl now.
[eyeneutral]
But uh...
{Something wrong?|Eye suits you!|Congrats!}
<A>
Um yeah I mean...
<B>
[eyeblush]
Oh well... Thanks!
I liked that the old one physically described my anatomy in such a clever and thoughtful way.
So I wanted something that still stuck to that.
[eyehappy]
Plus, I can change it again whenever really.
But uh... Well...
<C>
[eyehappy]
Thanks!
[eyehappyvery]
I got a long way to go but I think this is definitely right for me!
[eyeneutral]
But uh... Well...

I can't really play basketball for the school anymore since the girl's team is full.
So I'm gonna miss the qualifier.
[eyeunhappyextreme]
I was really looking forward to it too...
[eyeneutral]
But I'll manage...
Seeya Blonger...
